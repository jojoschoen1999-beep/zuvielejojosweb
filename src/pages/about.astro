    <p class="about-origin">i am a paris-based creative strategist, with a background in sociology and PR. when i first created my instagram account, i was 13 years old and frustrated that already too many jojos had signed up before me to have a cool short username. as a sign of protest (or out of lack of creativity) i went with &ldquo;zuvielejojos&rdquo; which directly translates to &ldquo;too many jojos&rdquo;. Since that moment more than a decade has passed but even after leaving the country (and having many french people ask me what the hell it means) my emotional attachment to this username has grown too much to change it. as you might have also noticed by now i am allergic to capital letters.</p>
